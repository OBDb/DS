This repository serves as a default fallback when a given make does not have its own signalset definitions. It contains signal set configurations for DS vehicles, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of DS vehicles.

## About DS

DS Automobiles is a French premium automobile manufacturer, a division of Groupe PSA (now part of Stellantis). The DS brand was officially established in 2014, though its history is closely tied to Citroën, from which it originated.

## Generations

- **Initial Phase as Citroën DS Line (2009-2014)**: The DS brand began as a premium sub-brand of Citroën, launched with the Citroën DS3 in 2009. This was followed by the DS4 and DS5 models. During this period, vehicles carried both Citroën and DS badging, establishing DS as a premium offering within the Citroën lineup.

- **Independent Brand (2014-present)**: In 2014, PSA Group announced that DS would become a standalone brand, separate from Citroën. The split was implemented gradually across different markets. This generation marked the transition to DS-exclusive designs and technologies, with models like the DS 7 Crossback (2017), DS 3 Crossback (2018), and DS 9 (2020) representing the brand's new identity. These vehicles feature distinctive styling elements including the "DS Wings" front grille, advanced lighting technology, and premium interior appointments.

- **Electrification Era (2018-present)**: Overlapping with its brand independence, DS has embraced electrification as a core part of its identity. Starting with the E-Tense versions of existing models, DS committed to offering electrified versions (either hybrid or full electric) of all its vehicles. The DS 3 Crossback E-Tense became the brand's first all-electric vehicle, followed by plug-in hybrid versions of the DS 7 Crossback and DS 9.
